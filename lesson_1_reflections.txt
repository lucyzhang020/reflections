How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

1. if one of the file is correct, then the errors should be introduced in another one
2. the code in another file that remains in the correct file should be correct
3. only the newly added ones are likely to have bugs in them
4. find those newly added code and that narrows down the amount of code we need to read
